You really should try archery while blindfolded. You don't know what you're missing.
You're living, you occupy space, and you have mass. You know what that means? You matter!
Your fingers have fingertips but your toes don't have toetips, yet you can tiptoe but not tipfinger.
Your veterinarian won't tell you this but if your dog is running a fever, go to the store and get some mustard. It's the best thing for a hot dog.
